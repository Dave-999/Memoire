In highly demanding industries such as aerospace and automotive, cutting edge innovation is a key factor to stay competitive and profitable. Ever more efficient materials are constantly developed.\\

Over the last decade, a very promising technology has emerged: selective laser melting (SLM). It has many appeals compared to other manufacturing processes, such as higher adaptability, better reliability and lower cost. However, a great deal of parameters influence the properties of the manufactured parts. Therefore, substantial research is needed \\

Using SLM with AlSi10Mg and other aluminium alloys has gained in popularity in recent years. The material has several fields of applications due to its light weight and relatively high strength.\\

Even though AlSi10Mg additive manufacturing is
