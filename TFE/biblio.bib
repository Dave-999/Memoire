	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

	Abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is widely gaining popularity as an alternative manufacturing technique for complex and customized parts. SLMis a near net shape process with minimal post processing machining required dependent upon final application. The fact that SLM produces littlewaste and enables more optimal designs also raises opportunities for environmental advantages. The use of aluminium (Al) alloys in SLM is stillquite limited due to difficulties in processing that result in parts with high degrees of porosity. However, Al alloys are favoured in many high-endapplications for their exceptional strength and stiffness to weight ratio meaning that they are extensively used in the automotive and aerospaceindustries. This study investigates the windows of parameters required to produce high density parts from AlSi10Mg alloy using selective lasermelting. A compromise between the different parameters and scan strategies was achieved and used to produce parts achieving a density of 99.8\%.},
